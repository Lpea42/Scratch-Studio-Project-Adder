# Scratch Studio Project Adder
This is a Python script that adds your project to many, many Scratch studios so everyone can see them and click on your project!
To use this, you need to install the scratchattach Python library. The scratchattach documentation can be found here: https://github.com/TimMcCool/scratchattach/wiki/Documentation

You can install scratchattach by opening your bash console and typing in this command:

```bash
pip install --user scratchattach
```

To use the Scratch Studio Project Adder script, download the raw .py file, or copy it and paste it into your Python IDE. Fill in the project ID and session cookie with your own. Once you run the script, you will get a few warnings in the output. After a few seconds, you will start to see messages that say your project has been added to the studio. You can check the studio on the Scratch website to see if your project is there.
